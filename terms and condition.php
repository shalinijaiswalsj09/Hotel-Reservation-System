In the interests of security and to prevent fraud, at the time of check-in, guests may be required to confirm their identity by providing their booking reference; their passport/identity card/driving licence and a valid credit or debit card which will be swiped in the presence of the card holder.  If guests are travelling from outside the UK, Ireland or any country in the Commonwealth we are also obliged by law to require guests to provide the number and place of issue of your passport/identity card and details of their next destination. These records will be kept for at least 12 months and may be disclosed or made available for inspection by any police officer or as otherwise required by applicable law in connection with the prevention or investigation of crime.

For advance purchase rates the card you booked with must be presented on arrival, along with the appropriate ID.

At the time of check-in we will authorise the accommodation charges (room rate, VAT and any service charge) and anticipated incidentals for the duration of your stay against your credit/debit card.  We may also choose to accept a deposit in place of payment card authorisation by another valid form of payment, including cash or cheque.

During your stay the Hotel’s system will calculate the incidentals charged to your room on a daily basis.  If the cost of those incidentals exceed the authorisation taken on check-in, further authorisation will automatically be requested and if such authorisation is not available, we may request another method of settlement or a deposit to be provided, failing which we reserve the right to restrict access to your room.

All outstanding charges must be paid for in full on check-out from the Hotel.  If the outstanding charges do not exceed the authorisation taken on check-in, the authorisation for the amount not utilised will be released, however, we cannot control how long it takes for your bank to effect such release.  If staying for multiple nights at the Hotel we may require you to make payment for any outstanding charges on a more frequent basis during your stay.

6. Cancellation Policy and No Shows

The cancellation policy varies according to the rate that is booked.  Please refer to the individual full rate descriptions given at booking.

For rates marked as “Flexible Rate” - These are cancellable without charge up to 2.00 p.m. local time on the day of arrival. Cancellation and non-arrival charges apply after the relevant time and will be charged to the credit/debit card supplied at the time of booking.  We reserve the right to charge for one night’s accommodation per room booked if the above cancellation requirements are not met.

For rates marked “Advance Saver” -  We require full prepayment for the entire stay at the time of the Booking and this is non-refundable and the Booking non-changeable.  Prepayment is charged to the credit/debit card supplied at the time of the Booking.   Cancellation or non-arrival will result in the forfeiture of the prepayment.

7. Changes or Cancellation by the Company

Very occasionally we may need to cancel your Booking.  In such circumstances you will be given a full refund but we shall have no further liability to you arising out of such cancellation.  We will, however, use reasonable endeavours to try and re-locate any confirmed Booking cancelled by us to an alternative location similar in standard to the Hotel.

Your booking is for a class of room in the Hotel and does not guarantee that you will be able to stay in a specific room or in the same room for the duration of your stay. If you have indicated a preference for a particular room through a "choose your own room" facility on the Website, we will use our reasonable efforts to honour this preference. However, we may need to allocate an alternative room to you for operational or safety reasons. If we need to move you to a different room during your booking for which a lower rate is available than the rate you booked at, we will refund you the difference in the rates.
